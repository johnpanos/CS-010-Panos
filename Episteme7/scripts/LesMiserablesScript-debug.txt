Don't look them in the eye
in your grave
in your grave
Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.
Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.
(EXCLAIMS IN ANNOYANCE)
I'll sleep in the stable.
(SINGING) Come in,
Get in there!
See in this some higher plan
Become a thief in the night
The cries in the dark
And the night is closing in
And the sun in the morning
There's a hunger in the land
to be in a job
And in a bed
With enough in your pocket
in some little town
her hands in the butter
to end in the gutter
in the light
in the night
And justice in our hand
In common cause
Smell 'em in the air
In that harbor over there
Waiting in the dark
Or a quick one in the park
Make money in your sleep
money in your hand
The hate that's in your head
in time gone by
in his stride
I was lost here in the dark
In such a place as this?
In His name
in Montfermeil.
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
in my place
Shall live in my protection
you come from God in heaven
(SIGHS IN DISMAY)
In mercy's name,
Every man is born in sin
There is power in me yet!
I like to go there in my sleep
Not in my castle on a cloud
There is a lady all in white
Not in my castle on a cloud
have taken you in
in the first place
You look very well in
from the well in the wood
Not in the darkness on my own
Spend their lives in my inn
Homing pigeons homing in
innkeeper in town
in the end!
Mix it in a mincer
looking in the mirror twice
bastard in the house
wandering in the wood
trembling in the shadows
to one in need
And I stand here in her place
in my protection
out in the darkness
He knows his way in the dark
Stars in your multitudes
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night
You know your place in the sky
And each in your season
You fall in flames!
Here in
in the land
(IN DISTINCT CHATTERING)
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air
That the tide now washes in?
In the absence of a victim
what you see in her
the blood in their veins
And to bring them in line!
Is Marius in love
in a moment of
in just one burst of light
rebellion ablaze in their eyes
with no doubt in our hearts
fall in love so fast?
In my life
In my life
I catch in the silence
In my life
Now the love in
in a time long ago
In my life
In your eyes I am
who was lost in a wood
In my life
to us all in our time
In our turn
In my life
is a dagger in me
In my life
BOTH : In my life
You're not needed in this
In the rain
Are misty in the river
In the darkness the trees
It's only in my mind
We will nip it in the bud
in the bud
What our God in heaven
has in store
Will you join in our crusade?
Then join in the fight
In the days
with this snake in the grass?
in the tavern in there
in the tavern in there
IN DISTANCE)
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
in the battle to come
COURFEYRAC: Get in there.
If it is in my power
In my need
who still live in fear
sleep in their beds!

(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
I would not give in!
He's standing in his grave!
To have me caught in a trap
Damned if I live in
right back in his face!
is lost in shadow
From the table in the corner
In sweat
In God's name,
Jean Valjean in
in a vicious attack
we see you all in hell!
Alone I wait in the shadows
You raised my child in love
(EXCLAIMS IN RELIEF)
Now I can die in peace
When you were in his keeping
Lord in heaven
Look down on him in mercy
the people sing lost in
We will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
in our crusade?
in our crusade?
